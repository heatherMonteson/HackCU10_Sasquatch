# Sass the 'Quatch's Berry Bad Day

### About
Do you ever want to just be left alone? Yeah, so does Sasquatch. With this game, tell some pesky photographers bothering your peace and quiet to bugger off by chucking your berry stash at them.
The game is fully coded in Java and all graphics were drawn by hand in sketchpad, all of which took place during the HackCU10 24 hour hackathon. 

### Future Work 
The next goal for this project is to add some more features as the most you can currently do is toss berries. Additional work to come: 

- Adding a "life" bar for the sasquatch that counts down as pictures are take 
- Add levels/challenges 
- Incorporate Multi threading 
- Add aim and shoot
- Include a score SS
